            <h2>Introduction to API Methods</h2>
            <p>
                APIs can be implemented using various protocols and methodologies. Each method has its own strengths, weaknesses, and ideal use cases. This guide compares the following methods:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>REST (Representational State Transfer)</li>
                <li>GraphQL</li>
                <li>JSON API</li>
                <li>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>REST (Representational State Transfer)</h2>
            <p>
                REST is a widely-used architectural style for APIs that works over HTTP. It uses standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. REST APIs are stateless and resource-based.
            </p>
            <h3>When to Use REST</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you need a simple, resource-oriented API.</li>
                <li>When caching is important for performance.</li>
                <li>For public APIs where simplicity and scalability are key.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>GraphQL</h2>
            <p>
                GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows clients to request exactly the data they need. It provides flexibility but requires more setup and learning.
            </p>
            <h3>When to Use GraphQL</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you need highly customizable and efficient data retrieval.</li>
                <li>For applications with complex relationships between data entities.</li>
                <li>When you want to avoid over-fetching or under-fetching data.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>JSON API</h2>
            <p>
                JSON API is a specification for building APIs in JSON. It standardizes how clients and servers communicate, reducing the amount of work required to integrate different APIs.
            </p>
            <h3>When to Use JSON API</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you want to adhere to a strict standard for API communication.</li>
                <li>For consistent API design across multiple projects.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol)</h2>
            <p>
                SOAP is a protocol that uses XML for messaging. It is highly standardized and supports advanced features like security, transactions, and ACID compliance.
            </p>
            <h3>When to Use SOAP</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>When you need strong security and transactional support.</li>
                <li>For enterprise-level applications and legacy systems.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Security Considerations</h2>
            <p>
                Security is a critical aspect of API design. Here are some key considerations and methods for authentication and authorization:
            </p>
            <h3>Authentication Methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Authentication:</strong> Simple and easy to implement but less secure. Requires transmitting username and password with every request.</li>
                <li><strong>OAuth 2.0:</strong> A widely used protocol for secure access delegation. Suitable for third-party integrations.</li>
                <li><strong>JWT (JSON Web Tokens):</strong> Used for stateless authentication. Tokens are compact and can be signed or encrypted for security.</li>
                <li><strong>API Keys:</strong> Simple, often used for identifying the client making the request. Should be combined with HTTPS for security.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Authorization Methods</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):</strong> Assigns permissions based on user roles.</li>
                <li><strong>Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC):</strong> Grants access based on user attributes and context.</li>
                <li><strong>Scopes:</strong> Common in OAuth 2.0, scopes define what a client can access.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>General Best Practices</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Always use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.</li>
                <li>Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse.</li>
                <li>Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.</li>
                <li>Log and monitor API activity for suspicious behavior.</li>
            </ul>
